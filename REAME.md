# Introduction Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## What is AI?
AI refers to machines that mimic human intelligence, reasoning, and decision-making to solve specific problems.

### AI vs. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):
AI: Focused on specific tasks; learns from data, reasons, and makes decisions.
AGI: Matches or surpasses human intelligence across various tasks.

Examples of AI:
          - Voice assistants
          - Facial recognition
          - Personalized recommendations
          - Autonomous robots

Applications Moving Towards AGI:
          - Self-driving cars
          - AlphaGo
          - Generative AI (e.g., GPT models)

## What AI Can and Cannot Do
Predictions and Inferences: Example Weather forecasts or book recommendations.
Pattern Recognition: Tasks include clustering, anomaly detection, and generative AI.
Optimization: Applications: Logistics, energy, tourism, marketing.
Automation: Example Document classification, job screening, or parcel management.

## Limitations:
Lack of social/emotional intelligence.
Inability to adapt to unseen scenarios or biases in data.

## Subdomains of AI
Machine Learning: Learning from data to make predictions or inferences. | Deep Learning: Neural networks for solving complex problems. | Knowledge Representation Reasoning and communication between AI systems. | Robotics: Acting and manipulating the physical environment. | Computer Vision: Visual recognition of objects in the environment.  | Natural Language Processing (NLP): Understanding and processing human language.

Examples of AI Applications
Personalized Recommendations: Machine Learning |  Warehouse Management: Robotics, Computer Vision | Medical Diagnosis: Deep Learning, Computer Vision | Smart Assistants: NLP, Deep Learning

Facial Recognition is a biometric technology that identifies or verifies a person’s identity using their facial features. It analyzes a person's face by mapping its geometry—such as the distance between the eyes, the shape of the cheekbones, and the contour of the jawline—and compares this data to a database of stored facial profiles.

## Key Components of Facial Recognition
Image Capture:
A camera captures an image or video of a person’s face.
Face Detection:
The system locates the face within the image or video frame.
Feature Extraction:
Key facial landmarks and features (e.g., eyes, nose, and mouth) are identified and measured.
Face Matching:
The extracted features are compared to stored profiles in a database to find a match.
Verification or Identification:
Verification: Confirms if the person matches a specific identity.
Identification: Determines who the person is from a group of profiles.

## Applications of Facial Recognition:
Authentication:
Unlocking smartphones and laptops (e.g., Apple's Face ID).
Verifying identity for financial transactions or access to secure areas.
